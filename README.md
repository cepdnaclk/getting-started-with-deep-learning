# Getting Started with Deep Learning

Are you ready to dive into the world of deep learning and harness its power for your projects? Look no further! This repository is here to help you get started with deep learning and understand its core concepts.

## Contents

This repository is packed with resources to help you get started with deep learning, including:

- **Starter Codes**: ðŸ’» Kickstart your deep learning journey with our ready-to-run code templates for various deep learning models and tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and generative models.

- **Tutorials**: ðŸ§  Brush up on the fundamentals of deep learning with step-by-step tutorials on neural networks. These tutorials will help you understand the theory and math behind deep learning.

- **Experiments**: ðŸ”¬ See deep learning in action with our real-world experiments that demonstrate how deep learning models can solve complex problems, such as image segmentation, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

- **Guides**: âœ¨ Learn how to use our GPU servers, [turing](https://faq.ce.pdn.ac.lk/network-n-servers/turing/) and [kepler](https://faq.ce.pdn.ac.lk/network-n-servers/kepler/), for deep learning. We'll show you how to set up your environment, run your models, and monitor their progress.

## Prerequisites

We assume that you have a strong foundation in computer engineering and a passion for deep learning! Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this repository is designed to help you take your deep learning skills to the next level. All you need is a basic understanding of Python programming and the willingness to learn and experiment. ðŸ¤“
